                            paying for the servers that host the website, the domain name, and any other costs
                            associated with running the project. Your money does not go towards paying the maintainers.

                            You will then be automatically given the 'backer' role. You will be prompted to provide your
                            Open Collective username, which is found in the URL of your Open Collective profile. For
                            example, if your profile URL is https://opencollective.com/rick-astley your username is
                            rick-astley.

                            If you want to remove the role for any reason, contact staff on discord through ModMail.</p>

                        <p>When The Odin Project was created by Eric Trautman in 2013, it was primarily funded by Eric's other project, the for-profit Viking Code School. Eric wanted Odin to be free, and kept it that way by placing a small ad for Viking Code School on the website.

                            In late 2017, Viking Code School was acquired by Thinkful. As a part of that acquisition, Thinkful agreed to continue funding The Odin Project, in return for an ad on The Odin Project website.
                            
                            In 2019, Thinkful was acquired by Chegg. Chegg was nothing but supportive, and continued funding us the entire time. However we began to feel that it might be in our best interest to become self-funding, to avoid the risk of being acquired by a company that might not be as supportive.
                            
                            In 2023, we decided to begin the process of parting ways with Chegg, and become self-funding. We are now funded entirely by donations.</p>
